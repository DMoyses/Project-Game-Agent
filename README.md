# Project-Game-Agent

Building a game playing agent for the game of isolation

Part 1: Coding and Analysis
Download the template code:
https://github.com/udacity/AIND-Isolation

Implement the following functions in game_agent.py:

MinimaxPlayer.minimax(): implement minimax search
AlphaBetaPlayer.alphabeta(): implement minimax search with alpha-beta pruning
AlphaBetaPlayer.get_move(): implement iterative deepening search
custom_score(): implement your own best position evaluation heuristic
custom_score_2(): implement your own alternate position evaluation heuristic
custom_score_3(): implement your own alternate position evaluation heuristic
For each of your three custom heuristic functions, evaluate the performance of the heuristic using the included tournament.py script. Then write up a brief summary of your results, describing the performance of the agent using the different heuristic functions verbally and using appropriate visualizations.
Submit the code file: game_agent.py
Submit your analysis as: heuristic_analysis.pdf
Your analysis should conclude with a comparison of the different heuristics and your reasoning for choosing the heuristic you ultimately use in your submitted agent.



Part 2: Research Review
The field of Artificial lIntelligence is continually changing and advancing. To be an AI Engineer at the cutting edge of your field, you'll need to be able to read and communicate some of these advancements with your peers. In order to help you get comfortable with this, in the second part of this project you will read a seminal paper in the field of Game-Playing and write a simple one page summary on it. Here are your instructions:

Select a Game-Playing paper from the following list or another of your choosing:

Game Tree Searching by Min / Max Approximation by Ron Rivest, MIT (Fun fact, Ron Rivest is the R is in the RSA cryptographic protocol).
Deep Blue by the IBM Watson Team (Fun fact, Deep Blue beat Gary Kasparov in Chess in one of the most famous AI spectacles of the 20th century).
AlphaGo by the DeepMind Team.
Other paper on Game-Playing of your choosing.
Write a simple one page summary of the paper covering the following:

A brief summary of the paper's goals or techniques introduced (if any).
A brief summary of the paper's results (if any).
